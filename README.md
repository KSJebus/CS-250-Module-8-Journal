## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- To understand user needs, active listening and "why" are employed initially to uncover the root issues behind feature requests. Users will often describe solutions rather than root causes, so peeling back using questions, observation, and confirmation is necessary. User stories bridge the gap between users and developers by capturing needs in a simple-to-understand manner: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [reason]." This facilitates keeping the attention on value delivery rather than technical details. User stories also isolate requirements into manageable chunks to handle, eliminate any uncertainty regarding acceptance tests to run, and enable prioritization so that teams can tackle first the most critical work. By keeping stories casual and intentionally short, they encourage ongoing conversation about implementation details and ensure everyone is aware not just of what to build, but why.
## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- I create programs by starting with a solid understanding of the problem, and breaking it into small, bite-sized pieces that can be built step by step. Rather than trying to get it all organized upfront, I like to put out a minimal viable product first and then iterate based on feedback. The Agile processes that I would like to utilize are sprint planning to work in dedicated short cycles, daily standups to keep everyone synchronized, and retrospectives to continually refine our process. I like test-first development to ensure quality code upfront, continuous integration to catch issues early, and pair programming for hard problems where collaboration produces better solutions. Most of all, I want to embrace Agile's core principle of embracing change.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Being an excellent team member in software development means integrating solid technical contributions with effective collaboration and communication. It is coding cleanly, maintainable code following team guidelines, providing thoughtful and helpful code reviews, and documenting decisions so that others can observe your thought process. Excellent team members are communicative actively. They work together with a growth mindset and humility, viewing mistakes as learning opportunities and valuing diverse opinions from fellow team members. Being a good team player ultimately means recognizing that software development is a team sport in which teamwork will win over individual achievement, and contributing your share to foster a healthy, supportive setting in which everyone can thrive in his or her role.
